\begin{frame}{Spending Effects: Estimating Substitution Patterns}
    primary parameters of interest are 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\beta_C$, the effect of prior authorization on choice utility \\
        identified from differences in a drugâ€™s market share among beneficiaries enrolled in plans that restrict it versus the market share among beneficiaries in plans that do not restrict it
        \item $\lambda_C$, governs the extent of intensive margin substitution \\
     compare the relative market shares of all other drugs from beneficiaries in plans that restrict a given drug, compared to the market shares of those drugs from beneficiaries in plans that do not restrict a given drug
    \end{itemize}
