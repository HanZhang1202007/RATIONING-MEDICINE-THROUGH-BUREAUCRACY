\begin{frame}{Model: When Should Policymakers Restrict Drugs?}
    this model implies drugs under the restriction should be: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimizing Administrative Costs: few inframarginal users
        \item Addressing Moral Hazard: incremental value is low
        \item Ideal drugs for restriction are expensive, niche-branded drugs, particularly new entrants in established therapeutic classes
    \end{itemize}
