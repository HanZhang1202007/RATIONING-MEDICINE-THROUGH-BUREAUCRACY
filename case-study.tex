\begin{frame}{Health Effects: Case Study of Oral Anticoagulants}
    understand the impact of prior authorization restrictions on access to non-Vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared to warfarin, a low-priced generic alternative, with:
    $$Y_{it}=\beta AuthAllNOACs_{j(it)t} + \gamma OtherFormulary_{j(it)t} + \delta_{m(it)} + \epsilon_{it} $$

    \begin{itemize}
        \item a significant reduction in spending, primarily due to patients switching to the cheaper warfarin
        \item health outcomes such as strokes, bleeding events, and death yield inconclusive results
    \end{itemize}
