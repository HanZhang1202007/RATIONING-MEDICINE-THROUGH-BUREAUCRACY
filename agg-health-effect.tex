    construct two indicators:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $AuthExposureQ5_i$ whether the beneficiaryâ€™s assigned plan was in the quantile with the most exposure to prior authorization
        \item $ExclExposureQ5_i$ assignment to the worst plans in terms of their exclusion of previously-taken drugs
    \end{itemize}
    $$Y_{it}=\beta AuthExposureQ5_i + \gamma ExclExposureQ5_i + \delta_{m(i)} + \epsilon_{i} $$
