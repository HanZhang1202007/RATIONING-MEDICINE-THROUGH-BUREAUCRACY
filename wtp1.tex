\begin{frame}{Welfare Effect: a Revealed Preference Approach}
    aim: estimate the total loss in consumer surplus due to being turned away from a drug
    $$\triangle CS_d = -\int_{\Theta_M} V_d(\theta) d\theta $$

    denote the WTP for drug $d$ for $\theta$ type consumer as $W_d(\theta_{id})$ \\
    the market demand curve is $D_d(P_d) =\int 1\{W_d(\theta) \geq P_d \}d \theta $ \\
    use the exogenous variation in $P_d$ to trace out $D_d (\cdot)$ and the distribution of $W_d$ \\
    if $W_d(\theta)=V_d(\theta)$, can get the distribution of $V_d$
