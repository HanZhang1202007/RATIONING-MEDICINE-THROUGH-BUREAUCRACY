\begin{frame}{Administrative Cost Burden}
    relevant parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item joint cost to both the physician (submit requests) and the insurer (process requests): $a$
        \item constant rejection rate across all drugs and years: $r$
        \item \# of patients taking the drug: $N$
    \end{itemize}    
    then there will be $\frac{N}{1-r}$ requests and the administrative cost is $\frac{aN}{1-r}$ \\
