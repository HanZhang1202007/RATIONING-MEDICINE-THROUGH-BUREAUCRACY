\begin{frame}{Prior Authorization Restrictions in Practice}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Prior Authorization Restrictions: insurers require approval from providers before covering certain medical services or prescription drugs 
       
        \item Purpose: ensures appropriate utilization of healthcare resources, control costs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the responses to questions on the prior authorization forms explicitly transmit information about value to the patient from experts (physicians) to payers
            \item The physicianâ€™s willingness to complete the forms implicitly signals to the payer that the value of the drug or treatment to the patient is high enough to justify going through the process.
