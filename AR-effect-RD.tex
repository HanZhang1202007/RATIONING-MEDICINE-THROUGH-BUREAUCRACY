\begin{frame}{Effect of on Drug Utilization: Research Design}
 solutions: 
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item
     %   For beneficiaries who face random assignment to default plans, their assigned plan is, by construction, orthogonal to any underlying drug preferences of the beneficiary themselves. Therefore, we 
     restrict to \textit{only} beneficiaries who faced random assignment to default plans.
   \item use an indicator for whether the drug was restricted under the beneficiary’s \textbf{assigned plan} as an \textbf{instrument} for whether the drug was restricted under the beneficiary’s \textbf{enrolled plan}, for each beneficiary-drug pair
   \item rich controls: drug-by-market fixed effects; assigned-plan-by-market fixed effects; whether the drug was excluded in the enrolled plan; formulary status of substitutes
 \end{enumerate}
