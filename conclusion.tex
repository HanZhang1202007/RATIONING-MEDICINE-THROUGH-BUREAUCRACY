\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reducing drug spending by \$96 per beneficiary-year , while only generating approximately \$10 in paperwork costs. The cost savings likely exceed beneficiariesâ€™ willingness to pay for foregone drugs.

        \item Despite its benefits, prior authorization policies may not be optimal if implemented more widely, and there may be more efficient alternatives for managing healthcare costs.
    \end{itemize}
